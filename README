This module will allow automated deployment of MCollective via puppet.

It is known to work on
- Centos 5.4 distributions
- Debian Squeeze
- Solaris 10

and requires a custom repo for MCollective (RPMS, debs, solaris
package) in order for the packages to work.

If you need to setup a Custom Repo, you can obtain instructions on how to do so at 
http://www.threedrunkensysadsonthe.net/2010/05/create-a-local-repository-for-mcollective-and-activemq/

To deploy new agents, simply copy the files into the "files/agent"
directory and they will be deployed on the next puppet run.
